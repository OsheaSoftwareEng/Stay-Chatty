## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React Native, JavaScript

 Stay Chatty is a mobile application that allows users to chat back in forth and share their locations. Users are also able to pick their own backgrounds and set their usernames upon launching the application.

## Optimizations

Planning on adding chat functionality and storing all the chats using the firebase database along with authenicating the users with firebase. Also I'm going to add a feature for users to send images from their phone to their friends through the chat.
